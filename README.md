### Updated Portfolio

 Updated site should have the following content:

* My name

* Links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as my email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of my resume

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * Screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

 Site should look"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for my site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Updated GitHub Profile 

* Update the following in my GitHub profile: 

    * Profile picture

    * Bio

    * Location

    * Email

    * Link to my portfolio

* Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at my GitHub profile, so put my best face forward. 

* Pin some repos that I want to highlight

  * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to my profile.

  * Click "Customize my pins"

  * Click the checkboxes for my project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

* Follow my classmates. They are the beginning of my professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.
